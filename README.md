# VicOS
Open-source OS designed to be simple, lightweight, and open-source.

## ROADMAP

Get hello world VGA Text ✔️

Make a basic terminal and test capabilities ✔️

Make custom shell and add basic commands ✔️

Add filesystem and filesystem commands ⚠️
(a previous iteration of the filesystem was succesful, saving files on RAM. Currently attempted an implementation of a system that gives you a installer to install the OS on a storage device. Cannot automatically detect devices and is unable to write or partition them.)
